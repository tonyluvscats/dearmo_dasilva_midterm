        <h1>Why MacOS is better than Windows (Anthony)</h1>

        <p>
            It's very clear that MacOS is the better operating system when compared to Windows. MacOS is one of the cleanest <br>
            and safest operating systems on the market. Due to the proprietary and private nature of Apple and their code, <br>
            MacOS is not easy to hack. This means that you don't need any special antivirus programs to remain relatively safe <br>
            on the internet, unlike on Windows. MacOS also offers a lot of valuable tools built-in to the operating system. This <br>
            includes apps like the Notes app, Facetime, and iMessage which have no equivalents built-in to Windows.One final <br>
            reason why MacOS is so much better than Windows is that it's an on-the-go operating system. You can easily sync files <br>
            between your Mac Computer, Laptop, and Tablet using MacOS' built-in tools. This allows people like creatives or busy <br>
            people to do whatever they need to do, wherever they are.

        <h1>Windows (Simon)</h1>

        <p>I believe that Windows is a much better OS then mac for many reasons. <br>
            Windows's Ease of use is much better than that of Macs, which is much more confusing. <br>
            Windows also has the benefit of having access to more programs and games, since they wont have been programed around mac as windows is the gold standard. <br>
            The actual astethic of Windows looks much cleaner and simpler than that of Macs, Macs over designs and ads to it being more confusing <br>
            Window is also much more affordable than Mac, with many Mac devices being much more expensive for a basic system. A Macbook pro ranges from $2500 - $4000, while you can get windows laptop of similair quality for around $1000<br>
            Windows File explorer is also much better than that of Macs. It is much easier to navigate while still allowing you to change files or find direct paths. <br>
            That is why I believe that Windows is superior to Mac.
