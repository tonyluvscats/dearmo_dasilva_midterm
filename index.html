        <h1>Why MacOS is better than Windows (Anthony)</h1>

        <p>
            MacOS is one of the cleanest and safest operating systems on the market.
            Due to the proprietary and private nature of Apple and their code, MacOS is not easy to hack.
            This means that you don't need any special antivirus programs to remain relatively safe on the internet, unlike on Windows.
            MacOS also offers a lot of valuable tools built-in to the operating system.
            This includes apps like the Notes app, Facetime, and iMessage which have no equivalents built-in to Windows.
            One final reason why MacOS is so much better than Windows is that it's an on-the-go operating system.
            You can easily sync files between your Mac Computer, Laptop, and Tablet.
            This allows people like creatives or busy people to do whatever they need to do, wherever they are.
