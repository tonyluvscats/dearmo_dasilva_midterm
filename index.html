        <h1>Why MacOS is better than Windows (Anthony)</h1>

        <p>
            MacOS is one of the cleanest and safest operating systems on the market.
            Due to the proprietary and private nature of Apple and their code, MacOS is not easy to hack.
            This means that you don't need any special antivirus programs to remain relatively safe on the internet, unlike windows.
            MacOS also offers a lot of valuable tools built-in to the operating system.
            This includes apps like the Notes app, Facetime, and iMessage which have no equivalents built-in to Windows.
