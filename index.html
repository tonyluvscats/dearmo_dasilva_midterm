        <p>
            It's very clear that MacOS is the better operating system when compared to Windows. MacOS is one of the cleanest <br>
            and safest operating systems on the market. Due to the proprietary and private nature of Apple and their code, <br>
            MacOS is not easy to hack. This means that you don't need any special antivirus programs to remain relatively safe <br>
            on the internet, unlike on Windows. MacOS also offers a lot of valuable tools built-in to the operating system. This <br>
            includes apps like the Notes app, Facetime, and iMessage which have no equivalents built-in to Windows.One final <br>
            reason why MacOS is so much better than Windows is that it's an on-the-go operating system. You can easily sync files <br>
            between your Mac Computer, Laptop, and Tablet using MacOS' built-in tools. This allows people like creatives or busy <br>
            people to do whatever they need to do, wherever they are.
        </p>
        <h3>Argument Against</h3>
        <p>
            I disagree with Anthony, who believes that Mac is better than windows. He says that Mac is cleaner looking but I don't agree, I believe it is <br>
            too clutered and much harder to navigate than pc. While it is true that Windows doesn't have the same equivalent apps built-in, you can easily <br>
            Install any type of equivalent such as skype and whatsapp or you can alternitivly use any google web application that is connected to the cloud <br>
            rather then on your device.

        <h2> Why Windows Is Better (Simon)</h2>

        <p>I believe that Windows is a much better OS then mac for many reasons. Windows's Ease of use is much better than that of Macs, which is much more confusing. <br>
            Windows also has the benefit of having access to more programs and games, since they wont have been programed around mac as windows is the gold standard. <br>
            The actual astethic of Windows looks much cleaner and simpler than that of Macs, Macs over designs and ads to it being more confusing  Window is also much <br>
            more affordable than Mac, with many Mac devices being much more expensive for a basic system. A Macbook pro ranges from $2500 - $4000, while you can get <br>
            windows laptop of similair quality for around $1000.Windows File explorer is also much better than that of Macs. It is much easier to navigate while still <br>
            allowing you to change files or find direct paths. That is why I believe that Windows is superior to Mac.
