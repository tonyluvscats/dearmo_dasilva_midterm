        <p>I believe that Windows is a much better OS then mac for many reasons. <br>
            Windows's Ease of use is much better than that of Macs, which is much more confusing. <br>
            Windows also has the benefit of having access to more programs and games, since they wont have been programed around mac as windows is the gold standard. <br>
            The actual astethic of Windows looks much cleaner and simpler than that of Macs, Macs over designs and ads to it being more confusing <br>
            Window is also much more affordable than Mac, with many Mac devices being much more expensive for a basic system. A Macbook pro ranges from $2500 - $4000, while you can get windows laptop of similair quality for around $1000<br>
            Windows File explorer is also much better than that of Macs. It is much easier to navigate while still allowing you to change files or find direct paths. <br>
            That is why I believe that Windows is superior to Mac.
