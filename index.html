        <h1>Why MacOS is better than Windows (Anthony)</h1>

        <p>
            It's very clear that MacOS is the better operating system when compared to Windows. MacOS is one of the cleanest <br>
            and safest operating systems on the market. Due to the proprietary and private nature of Apple and their code, <br>
            MacOS is not easy to hack. This means that you don't need any special antivirus programs to remain relatively safe <br>
            on the internet, unlike on Windows. MacOS also offers a lot of valuable tools built-in to the operating system. This <br>
            includes apps like the Notes app, Facetime, and iMessage which have no equivalents built-in to Windows.One final <br>
            reason why MacOS is so much better than Windows is that it's an on-the-go operating system. You can easily sync files <br>
            between your Mac Computer, Laptop, and Tablet using MacOS' built-in tools. This allows people like creatives or busy <br>
            people to do whatever they need to do, wherever they are.
